                    What the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const`?

                        <li>var:
                            Variables declared with var have function-level scope, which means they are scoped to the
                            nearest function containing them. If declared outside of any function, they become global
                            variables and are accessible throughout the entire program.var variables are hoisted to the
                            top of their containing function or global context, which means they are available for use
                            even before the declaration in the code.</li><br>

                        <li>let:
                            Variables declared with let have block-level scope. This means they are limited to the block
                            (inside curly braces {}) in which they are defined, such as within a function, loop, or
                            conditional block.Unlike var, let is not hoisted to the top of its containing block. It is
                            only accessible after the declaration.</li><br>

                        <li>Const:
                            Variables declared with const also have block-level scope, just like let.
                            const variables are used for values that should not be re-assigned after their initial
                            assignment. However, it's important to note that the value itself (if it's an object or
                            array) can still be modified.
                            Like let, const is not hoisted to the top of its containing block and is only accessible
                            after declaration.</li>

                    What the use cases of `null` and `undefined`?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>We have heard the word "null" many times in English. Its literal meaning is having no value. The
                        same meaning is analogous to the meaning of null in programming.Null is basically an assignment
                        value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.When
                        we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is empty or blank. It is to show
                        that the variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When it gets assigned to
                        a variable, it represents no value. The setting of the value must be done manually by the user
                        as JavaScript never sets the value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it to null.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As the name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign a
                        value to it, the variable becomes undefined.Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is
                        set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the run-time. When we do not pass
                        an argument for a function parameter, the default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a
                        function doesn't return a value, it returns undefined.</p>

                    What is a REST API?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or
                        devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to
                        the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For
                        this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.</p><br>
                    <p>First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST
                        provides a relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is
                        just one reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and
                        applications in a microservices architecture.</p>
